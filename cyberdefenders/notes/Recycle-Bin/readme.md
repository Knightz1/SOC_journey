- Normally, `deleted files` in Windows OS creates two files in `C:\$Recycle-Bin\{user_SID}` - one that starts with `$I` and another with `$R`. The `$I file` contains `metadata of the corresponding deleted file including its original path`.  
- Since the recycle bin `did not contain any $I files`, I assumed the `file may have been restored`
