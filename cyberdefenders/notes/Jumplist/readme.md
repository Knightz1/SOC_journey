Jump Lists are automatically created by Windows to allow users to ‘jump to’ or access items they frequently or recently accessed.  
There are two types of jump lists:  
- `Automatic Destinations` : created and maintained by OS  
- `Custom Destinations` : created and maintained by developers of custom applications that utilize jump list
